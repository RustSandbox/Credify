* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
* Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
    * üé® `:art:` when improving the format/structure of the code
    * üêé `:racehorse:` when improving performance
    * üìù `:memo:` when writing docs
    * üêõ `:bug:` when fixing a bug
    * üî• `:fire:` when removing code or files
    * ‚úÖ `:white_check_mark:` when adding tests

* Keep documentation up to date with code changes
* Use proper markdown formatting

## Testing

* Write tests for new functionality
* Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
